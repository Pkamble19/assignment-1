    "Q1. Text files and binary files are fundamentally different in the way they store and represent data. Text files store data in a human-readable format where characters are encoded using a specific character encoding (e.g., ASCII or UTF-8), and lines are separated by newline characters. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in a non-human-readable format, where data is represented using binary code that is not meant to be read by humans. Binary files are used to store data that needs to be accessed more efficiently or that is not intended to be modified by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Text files are better for storing and processing data that is in human-readable format, such as text documents or configuration files. Binary files are more appropriate for storing data that is not meant to be read or modified by humans, such as images, audio or video files, or serialized objects. Binary files are also faster to access and process than text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. One issue with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk is that the endianness of the system may affect the way the integer is stored. Endianness refers to the order in which the bytes of a multi-byte value are stored in memory. Different systems may use different endianness, which can cause issues when reading or writing binary data across different platforms. It's generally recommended to use a library like the struct package to handle binary data in a portable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The with keyword is a context manager that automatically takes care of opening and closing files, even in the event of an error. This ensures that resources are properly released and can prevent issues like file locks or data corruption. Using with can simplify code and make it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When reading a line of text, Python includes the newline character (\\n) at the end of the line, if it exists. When writing a line of text, Python does not append a newline character automatically, but it can be added using the print() function or by explicitly writing a newline character (\\n) to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. The seek() and tell() file operations enable random-access operation. seek() allows you to move the file pointer to a specific position in the file, and tell() returns the current position of the file pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The struct package is most commonly used when working with binary data formats, such as network protocols, file formats, or machine code. It provides a way to pack and unpack data in a portable and efficient way, allowing Python to interface with other systems that use binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Pickling is a good option for serializing complex Python objects to a file. Pickling can handle complex data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and custom classes, and allows you to save and load these objects with minimal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. The shelve package is useful when you need to store large amounts of persistent data that can be easily accessed and modified by multiple processes. It provides a dictionary-like interface for storing and retrieving data, and automatically handles serialization and deserialization of Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. One special restriction of using the shelve package is that the keys of the dictionary must be strings. This is because the keys are used as filenames on disk, and non-string keys would cause issues with the file system.\n",
