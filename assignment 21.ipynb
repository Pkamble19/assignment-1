    "Q1. A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining various outcomes in an experiment or random event. It tells us how often different outcomes occur in a given sample space or population. Although the values in a probability distribution are random, the distribution itself is predictable because it follows a specific pattern or formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. True random numbers are generated by physical means, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay, and are truly unpredictable. Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated using algorithms that simulate randomness. While they are not truly random, they are considered \"good enough\" because they exhibit statistical randomness and have a uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The two main factors that influence the behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution are the mean and the standard deviation. The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread or width of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. A real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of heights or weights in a population. In general, most people will be of average height or weight, with fewer individuals on either extreme end of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the short term, a probability distribution may not behave predictably due to random variation. However, as the number of trials or observations increases, the distribution will tend to converge towards its expected values and become more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. The random.shuffle function can be used to shuffle a list object in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The math package in Python contains functions related to mathematical operations and calculations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and statistical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Exponentiation and logarithms are inverse operations. Exponentiation involves raising a base value to a given power, while logarithms involve determining the exponent needed to produce a given result when the base value is raised to that exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Python supports three logarithmic functions: math.log, math.log10, and math.log2. The math.log function computes the natural logarithm, math.log10 computes the logarithm with base 10, and math.log2 computes the logarithm with base 2.\n",
