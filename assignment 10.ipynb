    "# Q1.What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is that __getattr__ is only called when an attribute cannot be found via the usual lookup rules, whereas __getattribute__ is called for every attribute access. In other words, __getattr__ is a fallback method for missing attributes, whereas __getattribute__ is a more general method for intercepting attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and descriptors are both ways to customize attribute access in Python. Properties are a simpler mechanism that allows you to define getter and setter methods for an attribute, which are called automatically when the attribute is accessed or modified. Descriptors are a more powerful mechanism that allows you to define custom behavior for attribute access, by defining special methods that are called when the attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3.What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__ is called when an attribute is not found using the usual lookup rules, whereas __getattribute__ is called for every attribute access, even if the attribute exists. Properties provide a way to customize attribute access by defining getter and setter methods, while descriptors allow you to define custom behavior for attribute access by defining special methods such as __get__, __set__, and __delete__. In terms of functionality, properties are simpler and more limited than descriptors, but they are also easier to use and more commonly used in Python code."
