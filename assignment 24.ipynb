    "Q1. Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. The goal might be to import specific items from the module into different parts of the code or to give the imported module a different name to avoid conflicts with other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Modules are files that contain Python code and are used to organise code into reusable, self-contained units. They allow for code modularity, which makes it easier to maintain, test and reuse code. Modules can contain variables, functions, classes and other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. To avoid circular importing, one approach is to refactor the code so that the dependencies are unidirectional, meaning that one module depends on another, but not vice versa. Another approach is to move the common code that both modules require to a third module, which can then be imported by both modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The _ all _ attribute is a list that specifies the public interface of a module. When the attribute is defined, it lists the names of the objects that should be imported when the module is imported using the \"from module import *\" syntax. This helps prevent name clashes and provides a clear, documented API for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. It is useful to refer to the _ name _ attribute or the string '_ main ' in situations where a module can be used both as a standalone program and as a library. By checking whether _ name _ is equal to ' main _', you can determine whether the module is being run as the main program or imported as a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application can provide several benefits, such as allowing the interpreter to keep track of the current line number, making it easier to debug and providing better error messages. It can also be useful for implementing features like conditional statements and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. To render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, the minimum expressions or statements needed would include arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), variables, control structures (if/else statements, loops), functions, and input/output operations. With these basic building blocks, a wide range of programming tasks can be carried out.\n",
