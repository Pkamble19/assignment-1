    "An abstract superclass is a class that is intended to be inherited from but not instantiated directly. It defines common attributes and methods that its subclasses should implement, but it does not provide a complete implementation of those methods. Instead, it leaves the implementation up to its subclasses. Abstract superclasses are often used to define interfaces or to provide a common base for a group of related classes."

When a subclass overrides the init method of its superclass, it can modify the initialization process, but it still needs to call the superclass's init method to ensure that any necessary setup is performed. This is typically done using the super() function, which returns a temporary object of the superclass and allows access to its methods."

For example, if a superclass has a method that adds two numbers, a subclass can call the method using super() and then add an additional number to the result.

Finally, class methods and static methods have their own special scoping rules, which can affect how names are resolved within the class."
